<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Abinesh, a passionate computer scientist with a fresh MSc degree in Computer Science
   from a central university. I thrive on turning complex problems into elegant solutions and am always eager to explore the ever-evolving landscape 
   of technology.</p>

<p> One of my notable projects involved implementing a Face Recognition system using Support Vector Classification (SVC) in Python.
   I enjoyed the challenge of working with computer vision and creating a solution that can identify faces with precision.</p>

<p>Another project close to my heart is the prediction of chronic kidney disease using machine learning, implemented in MATLAB.
   This project not only honed my data analysis skills but also fueled my commitment to applying technology for healthcare advancements.</p>

<p>On the technical side, I'm well-versed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling me to craft engaging and responsive web experiences. 
  I'm also experienced in Docker, allowing me to deploy and manage applications seamlessly.</p>
<p> Let's connect! I'm always open to collaboration, learning, and sharing insights with fellow enthusiasts.
